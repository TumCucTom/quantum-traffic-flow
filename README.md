# Quantum Traffic Flow Optimization App

This repository contains the **Quantum Traffic Flow Optimization App**, a project leveraging the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to enhance local traffic management in Bristol, England. The app dynamically optimizes traffic light timings and reroutes vehicles to reduce congestion and improve overall traffic flow. Accident mitigation may also be added.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Optimization**: Uses live traffic data to minimize congestion and optimize signal timings.
- **Quantum Computing Integration**: Implements QAOA for solving traffic flow optimization problems.
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Displays real-time traffic patterns and optimized routes.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach**: Combines classical preprocessing algorithms with quantum computations for practical and scalable solutions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-traffic-app.git
   cd quantum-traffic-app
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up API Keys**:
    - Register and obtain API keys for Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and National Highways APIs.
    - Add these keys to the `.env` file in the root directory:
      ```env
      GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
      NATIONAL_HIGHWAYS_API_KEY=your_highways_api_key
      ```

5. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
